Well... Since i like self hosting i also host a few different sites, either just for me or for the public :3
_In general for private puprose because i am an idiot and dont want to be responsible for others__.

But yeah lets stop the yap

## 1. ConvertX
I mean if youre interested [host it yourself](https://github.com/C4illin/ConvertX) but otherwise feel free to use mine. Just register and then convert...
That bitch supports too many file formats... but for ex jpg to svg didnt work, so no guarantee it works :3
- [convertx](https://conv.nicgeon.de/)

## 2. Metube
Again [host it urself :>](https://github.com/alexta69/metube). Butt metube at first glance seems really good. With a [browser extension](https://github.com/alexta69/metube?tab=readme-ov-file#browser-extensions) and overall support for a lot of [different plattforms](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md) (yes even pornhub...).
> **But disclaimer: Downloads are not only visable for you but for everyone visiting (except if you clear them ofc xD).**

## 3. Cloudgeon
_Data where its not supposed to be stored_. I love that slogan, because it fits. Teachnically you could get a few GB of free storage + a online Office + Calendar + Kanban Board. But honestly [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/install/) is a bit of a mess with trying to be a lot at once. It is very cool tho and i can reccomend it. Yeah but feel free to make an account. 
> **BUT PLEASE DO NOT STORE IMPORTANT THINGS ON THERE** i am not responsible for data loss.

## 4. Soundgeon | Funkwhale
_Very unstable_ - Funkwhale is a self hosted music streaming service. Songs are uploaded by users. Sadly it still is very unreliable atm, but i hope that with more releases the stability will increase. You could either [host it urself](https://www.funkwhale.audio/) or join mine :3. I'd be happy about more music and more activity

    Oh btw two great apps for funkwhale/subsonic servers:
    - [Symfonium](https://www.symfonium.app/) (Android)
    - [Feishin](https://github.com/jeffvli/feishin) (Windows)

## 5. Nigchen | Kitchenowl
Simple, yet effective. [Kitchenowl](https://kitchenowl.org/) is a nice Self hosted alternative to apps like Bring or others. Basicly a shared shopping list for families or roomates. It als offers a financial overview, recepies and a cooking planner. We're still testing it. But feel free to join my instance ;p

Oh and one funny thing... my services are offline at night due to the Server being located in my room.

_maybe i should name them all something with -geon like Congeon or Dowgeon_
