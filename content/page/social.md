As written in my Portfolio i am activley providing content on plattforms like [youtube]() and [twitch](). Mostly focused on gaming content and the game SCP Secret Labratory.
Currently my youtube channel is on hold due to a lack of entertaining content coming from the games i play. 

> ## Twitch
The most activity youll see on my beautiful social media presence is probaply twitch. I am currently streaming three times per week, with content ranging from just chatting to some weird indie horror Game. \
I escpailly have the focus of making the stream interactable, either thoguth a soundboard or though allowing to do inputs ingame, no i dont let them play the game but instead i let them kill me...

Currently my streaming times are:

- **Tuesdays**
    - `21:00` to `22:30`
- **Fridays**
    - `21:00` to `22:30`
- **Sundays**
    - `21:00` to `23:30`

```
All these times are in my local time (UTC+01:00)
```
I'd highly reccoment joining my [discord](discord.gg/SvaP4wS7rz) to get updates for the newest features and changes ;)
