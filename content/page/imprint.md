### Liability for Content

The contents of our pages have been created with the utmost care. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the content. As service providers, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with § 7, para. 1 DDG (German Digital Services Act) under general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 DDG, however, we as service providers are not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific legal violation. Upon becoming aware of corresponding legal violations, we will remove such content immediately.

### Liability for Links

Our website contains links to external third-party websites over whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any guarantee for this external content. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking. However, permanent content monitoring of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a legal violation. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.

### Copyright

The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law. Reproduction, editing, distribution, and any form of exploitation outside the limits of copyright law require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this page are only permitted for private, non-commercial use. Insofar as the content on this page was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are observed. In particular, third-party content is identified as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright violation, we ask for a corresponding notice. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such content immediately.

### Privacy Policy

The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data. Insofar as personal data (for example, name, address, or email addresses) is collected on our pages, this is done on a voluntary basis wherever possible. This data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent.
We point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g., when communicating via email) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.
We hereby expressly object to the use of contact data published within the framework of the legal notice obligation by third parties for sending unsolicited advertising and information materials. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as through spam emails.
